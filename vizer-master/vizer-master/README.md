## My Code

I have designed a basic synthwave inspired visualiser that uses different aspects as music to change how it looks. 

I currently have it working as;

 - words are the lyrics
 - vocals change the transparency of all the elements, and fades the lyric into the background
 - drum controls the blue pillars
 - bass controls the purple pillars
 - other controls the pink "sun" in the middle

 this code uses maps, for loops, and arrays. This is a very simple and quick design, it took me only around 3 or 4 hours total without all of the experimentation. I wanted to add something in that would move to the bpm of the music, and play around with more background elements, unfortunatley, ran out of time.
